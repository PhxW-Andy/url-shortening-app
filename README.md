# **URL shortening app**

## Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is a simple app where you can shorten a link. All links are getting stored in localStorage. You can copy or delete the shorten link by clicking the button beside that. The focus is on the shorten functionality. Everything else is just part of the design.

### install all dependencies

> npm install

### run app in browser

> npm run dev
